# Address_Space_and_Resource_Usage
This assignment has three main goals. First, you will learn in concrete terms
what the different segments of a virtual address space (or simply address space) are. Second,
you will learn to use three Linux facilities - /proc, strace, and getrusage - to
record/measure certain aspects of process resource usage. Finally, we hope that Lab 1 will
serve to refresh your understanding of (or make you learn in case you lack it): (i) logging
into a Linux machine (ssh, VPN, 2FA) and using basic Linux shell and commands, (ii)
compiling a C program (gcc, make), creating/linking against libraries, (iii) debugging
(gdb), (iv) working with a code repository (github), (v) using Linux man pages (the man
command), and (vi) basic hexadecimal arithmetic.
